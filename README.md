# Getting Started with Create React App

## Installation

To install the application, first make sure that you have Node.js and NPM installed on your computer. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.("https://github.com/vipintechneutron/managepay.git")
- Navigate to the root directory of the project.
- Make sure node version will be updated.
- Run the command npm install to install all dependencies.
  npm install
- Use npm start command for running the project in local
  npm start


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


## Development

To start the development server, run the command `npm start` in the terminal. This will start the server and open a new tab in your default web browser

Note:
-If you don't find npm in existing machine then install by npm using:
  npm i -g npm  
  After installing npm, restart your machine(not mandatory)
-If you are facing file rename errors or library version mismatch then:
  Try to clean node_modules
  Try to remove npm & Install again
  Try to remove package-lock.json
  Now try npm install
